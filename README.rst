        #. Handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly error messages
    #. Responsive Design:
        #. Create a responsive layout that works well on desktop and mobile devices
    #. Unit Testing:
        #. Write unit tests for critical business logic methods
        #. Aim for at least 50% code coverage

Technical Requirements
----------------------
    #. Use ASP.NET Core 6.0 or later
    #. Implement Entity Framework Core for database operations
    #. Utilize ASP.NET Core MVC for the web application structure
    #. Implement RESTful API endpoints for external services (if needed)
    #. Use Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling
    #. Implement proper logging throughout the application
    #. Follow SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns
    #. Use dependency injection for better maintainability
    #. Implement proper error handling and exception management

Deliverables
------------
    #. Source code repository (e.g., GitHub) with the completed project
    #. Documentation:
        #. Project overview
        #. System requirements
        #. Database schema
        #. API documentation (if implemented)
        #. Unit test report
    #. Presentation slides (5-10 minutes) explaining the project, its features, and challenges faced during development

Evaluation Criteria
-------------------
    #. Functional completeness (40%)
    #. Code quality and organization (30%)
    #. Performance and scalability (15%)
    #. Security and best practices (10%)
    #. Documentation and presentation (5%)
	
This assignment provides a comprehensive set of tasks that will challenge an average C# programmer over a two-week period. It covers various aspects of ASP.NET development, including CRUD operations, authentication, search functionality, and best practices. The evaluation criteria ensure that both the functional aspects and the overall quality of the code are assessed.
